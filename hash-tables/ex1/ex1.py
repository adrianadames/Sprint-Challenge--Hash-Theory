# Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item weights, 
# implement a function get_indices_of_item_weights that finds two items whose 
# sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a 
# tuple (i, j) of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If 
# such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty tuple.

# Your solution should run in linear time.
