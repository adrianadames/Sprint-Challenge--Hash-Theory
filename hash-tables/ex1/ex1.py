# Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item weights, 
# implement a function get_indices_of_item_weights that finds two items whose 
# sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function should return a 
# tuple (i, j) of the indices of the item weights, ordered such that i > j. If 
# such a pair doesnâ€™t exist, return an empty tuple.

# Your solution should run in linear time.

#given the list weights of item weights, return the index of the two weights (as a tuple) that add up to limit

  weights_dict = {}
  #step 2: populate weights_dict hash table with the weights in weights as keys and the index of the weight in the array as the corresponding value.

    # print(limit-weight)
